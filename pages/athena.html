                    leading me to make a few modifications to the original design so there would be enough room

                    I have been called an absolute lunatic for coding a robot dog as my first robotics project ever, and

                    This has been BY FAR the hardest thing I have ever done, as I have toiled endlessly with dependency

                    project I would have otherwise kept as an R/C curiosity, an edge-AI chip, and alphanumeric
