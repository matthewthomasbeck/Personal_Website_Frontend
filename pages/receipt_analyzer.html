          How often they visited a location, city, or state; a line of best fit representing their earning or spending

          easy-to-digest manner, as well as a trend line that provides a more accurate representation of the data; and

          This receipt analyzer represents the first brick laid in my programmatic foundation, as because it was my
          first real project, it marks the first time I had to think about how to structure a program, how to make it
          user-friendly, and how to make it look good
        </p>
        <p class="contentText projectConclusionText">
          But on a more personal note, it was also what made me realize that if I really wanted to stand out, not just
          as a student, or as a professional, but as a human being, I would have to do more than what I was currently
          doing, and I would have to start questioning the ideas that I had held based on the results they had given me
        </p>
        <p class="contentText projectConclusionText">
          The strategies I learned when trying to juggle everything in life while working on this little project are
          tools I still use as of writing, and without this project that I started when I was barely 21, who knows how
          long it would have taken me to eventually learn them

        <p class="contentText projectConclusionText">
          This software needs improvement; Python GUI's leave much to be desired, the code should not only be a handful
          of files, my regex functions could probably be better, and my database was accidentally OPEN TO THE NETWORK
          (I closed the ports after an absolute hero family friend n-mapped and found them, and I'm so thankful nobody
          in my building decided to punish me)

          But I'm not deleting a single line of code; 'Receipt_Analyzer_3.0' taught me that if I need to do this again,
          I'm perfectly capable of writing some more
